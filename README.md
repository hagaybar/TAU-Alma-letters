# TAU-Alma-letters

This repository contains a collection of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) stylesheets used to generate and format email notifications and slips for the Alma library management system. These stylesheets have been customized to meet the specific needs of the Tel-Aviv University libraries.

## Overview

The XSLT files in this repository are designed to transform XML data generated by Alma into user-friendly HTML-formatted emails. These emails cover a wide range of library notifications, such as:

*   Loan receipts and due date reminders
*   Overdue and lost item notices
*   Hold requests and pickup notifications
*   Resource sharing and digitization requests
*   General library communications

The stylesheets are modular and include common components for headers, footers, and styling, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all notifications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   `xslt/`: This directory contains the main XSLT files for different types of letters and notifications. Each file corresponds to a specific Alma letter.
*   `xml/`: This directory contains sample XML files that can be used for testing the XSLT transformations.
*   `xslt-local-location/`: This directory contains localized or institution-specific XSLT templates and configurations.

## Usage

These stylesheets can be uploaded to the Alma system to customize the appearance and content of library notifications. To use them, you will need access to the Alma configuration settings for letters and slips.

**Note:** These stylesheets are tailored for Tel-Aviv University and may require modification to be used in other institutions.
